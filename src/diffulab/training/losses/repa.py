class RepaLoss(LossFunction):
    """Representation Alignment (REPA) loss.

    Aligns intermediate features from a denoiser (MMDiT) to features from an
    external vision encoder (e.g., DINOv2) using a projection MLP and, optionally,
    a Perceiver resampler. Denoiser features are captured via a forward hook on a
    specified transformer block and compared to encoder features using cosine
    similarity. The loss is averaged over the sequence dimension and scaled by
    ``coeff``.

    Typical usage:
        loss_fn = RepaLoss(...)
        loss_fn.set_model(denoiser)
        # Run a forward pass through the denoiser to populate captured features
        loss = loss_fn(x0=batch_images)  # or pass dst_features=...

    Args:
        repa_encoder: Key of the encoder to instantiate. Supported values are
            keys of ``encoder_registry``, e.g. "dinov2".
        encoder_args: Keyword arguments forwarded to the encoder constructor.
        alignment_layer: 1-based index of the MMDiT layer from which to capture
            features.
        denoiser_dimension: Feature dimensionality of the denoiser at the
            alignment layer.
        hidden_dim: Hidden size of the projection MLP.
        load_dino: Whether to instantiate and load the encoder. Set to ``False``
            when precomputed ``dst_features`` will be supplied at call time.
        embedding_dim: Target embedding dimensionality when the encoder is not
            instantiated (i.e., when ``load_dino=False``).
        use_resampler: Whether to apply a :class:`PerceiverResampler` after the
            projection MLP.
        resampler_params: Configuration for the :class:`PerceiverResampler`.
            Required if ``use_resampler=True``.
        coeff: Multiplicative weight applied to the returned loss value.

    Attributes:
        repa_encoder: The instantiated encoder or ``None`` if
            ``load_dino=False``.
        proj: Projection MLP mapping denoiser features to the encoder embedding
            space.
        resampler: Optional :class:`PerceiverResampler` applied after the
            projection.
        alignment_layer: 1-based index of the hooked MMDiT layer.
        coeff: Multiplicative weight applied to the returned loss.
