# To-Do List

- [x] Correct github CI
- [x] Add the possibility to noise only part of the data (for image conditioning for instance, palette style)
- [x] add DDIM to Gaussian Diffusion
- [ ] add guidance to rectified flow    
- [ ] Complete the different init files
- [ ] add reflow algorithm
- [ ] add mixed precision training
- [ ] double check logging on wandb is working during training
- [ ] add resume training function to the Trainer
- [ ] add some context embedders
- [ ] code from scratch DiT (to be tested)
- [ ] doc string and comment
- [ ] add EDM
- [ ] Train our models on toy datasets for different tasks 
- [ ] Add possibility to train LORA/DORA
- [ ] Add the possibility to diffuse in the latent space (add a vae at initialization of our denoisers)
- [ ] add different timesteps schedule in flows
- [ ] Test ajout differential transformer dans mmDiT
- [ ] Voir pour ajouter https://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.02507
- [ ] inject lessons learned from nvidia https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/rethinking-how-to-train-diffusion-models/
