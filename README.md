# To-Do List

- [ ] Correct github CI
- [ ] Add the possibility to diffuse in the latent space (add a vae at initialization of our denoisers)
- [ ] Add the possibility to noise only part of the data (for image conditioning for instance, palette style)
- [ ] Get more knowledge on the different sampling method for the different frameworks and implement them
- [ ] Train our models on toy datasets for different tasks 
- [ ] Figure out how to launch an accelerate run within a script not launched with accelerate script.py
